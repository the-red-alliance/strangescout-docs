## What is StrangeScout?

*StrangeScout* is the one-of-a-kind scouting system developed for [FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) teams. FIRST is a multinational organization designed to give students through high school hands on learning experiences in STEAM fields, by providing them with challenging and engaging competitions to construct robots and compete with them. A key element of any FRC event is scouting, where teams will track the capabilities of other team's robots to help determine their play strategy and who they may ally with later in the event. This is where StrangeScout comes in.

## How it works

StrangeScout is built with a unique approach to scouting. While the traditional method involves a checklist or similar method where scouts count individual occurrences of a wide variety of potential events, StrangeScout uses a journaling method. For example, if the current game involves picking up balls and placing them into a box, the scouters will only be presented with a single button: "pick up a ball". When the robot they're tracking picks up a ball they click this button. Then, a new dialog will appear presenting them with a list of options where the ball may go, which they will then choose when the robot places the ball in that location. This system allows for precise tracing of robots actions, while maintaining simplicity and ease of usability for the actual scouters.
