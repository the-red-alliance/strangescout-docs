## What is StrangeScout?

*StrangeScout* is the one-of-a-kind scouting system developed for [FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) teams. FIRST is a multinational organization designed to give students through high school hands on learning experiences in STEAM fields, by providing them with challenging and engaging competitions to construct robots and compete with them. A key element of any FRC event is scouting, where teams will track the capabilities of other team's robots to help determine their play strategy and who they may ally with later in the event. This is where StrangeScout comes in.
